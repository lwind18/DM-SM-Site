# the first part is we need use OAuth interface to authorise our app to access twitter
# consume:
consumer_key = "YOUR OWN KEY"
consumer_secret = "YOUR OWN SECRET"

# access:
access_token = "YOUR OWN ACCESS TOKEN"
access_token_secret = "YOUR OWN ACCESS TOKEN SECRET"

# setup access API
auth = tweepy.OAuthHandler (consumer_key, consumer_secret)
auth.set_access_token (access_token, access_token_secret)
api = tweepy.API (auth)

file = open('twitter.csv', 'a')
filewte = csv.writer (file)
